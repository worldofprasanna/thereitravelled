    <p>For long time we (Myself &amp; Archana) were planning a trip to Tirupathi and getting up to Tirumala by walk. I know there is a footpath there, but never dared to try it out. Somehow this time, I got excited about trekking and decided that we should try it out.</p>

<p>We started from Chennai around 5:45 PM in car and booked a hotel room in Tirupathi for 2 days. Reached the hotel around 11 PM and it was slightly far from the city, but reachable place.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/resources/images/tirupathi-trek-1/start-trek.jpeg" alt="Start of Trek" height="400px" /></p>

<p>I didn t sleep the whole night, kind of excited about the experience. Got up around 3 AM and reached bus stand around 4 AM. I was kind of shocked to see a huge crowd standing there to get the darshan ticket, and I met 2 - 3 people who said they can buy a darshan ticket for me, as the foot path ticket would already be filled by now.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/resources/images/tirupathi-trek-1/start.jpeg" alt="Steps Board" height="400px" /></p>

<p>But we thought of giving a try and reached the start of footpath where they placed a counter saying that 5000 tickets pending still. I was relaxed to see that and started climbing the steps.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/resources/images/tirupathi-trek-1/steps.jpeg" alt="Steps Board" height="400px" /></p>

<p>Initial 200 steps were okish, after that it started becoming very steep and we started taking lot of breaks. Inspite of the breaks I felt we were progressing much faster compared to our peer footpathers.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/resources/images/tirupathi-trek-1/tired.jpeg" alt="Steps Board" height="400px" /></p>

<p>We reached a place Kali Gopuram. Then only we realised that the current number of tickets available for the footpath was drammatically reduced to 300. And by luck we didn t take any long breaks. Finally we stand at the queue and got the darshan ticket with the time mentioned as 7 PM. It was 6 AM in the morning, I was not sure what I am going to do till 7 PM in the evening at Tirumala.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/resources/images/tirupathi-trek-1/kaligopuram.jpeg" alt="Steps Board" height="400px" /></p>

<p>After Kali gopuram, it was flat. In the footpath there were total of 3600 steps and to reach Kali gopuram, it took 1500 steps approx. So I thought only 2000 steps left and it would take another 1 - 1.5 hours to reach tirumala. But I was wrong.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/resources/images/tirupathi-trek-1/deers.jpeg" alt="Steps Board" height="400px" /></p>

<p>Eventhough the steps are not that steep now, it was very long. After kali gopuram, it took 6 - 7 kms to reach Tirumala. At times, we were walking in the road with the vehicles coming in opposite direction and finally another steep 500 steps. Thats it we reached Tirumala.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/resources/images/tirupathi-trek-1/completion.jpeg" alt="Steps Board" height="400px" />
The time is 8:20 AM. We started around 5 AM and reached Tirumala in 3.5 hours. Comparitively, it was quicker. We had breakfast in Hotel Sarangapani and gone to stand in line by 10 AM itself. We thought it was a waste to wait till 7 PM and then standing in line. Luckily they allowed us inside at 10 AM itself. It seems there is no time constraint there.</p>

<p>Finally we had the darshan of Venkatachalapthy and came out around 1 PM. We were so much tired that we took bus and reached Tirupath bus stand. We didn t do anything much that day. Complete rest.</p>

<p>Next day morning we started to Padmavathi temple in Alamelu mangapuram, but it was closed for 1.5 hours, they said some pooja is happening. So we left that place, roamed around Tirupathi for sometime and started back to Chennai.</p>

Early morning oxygen, Sunrise and the trek experience was more memorable. I will plan another trip to Tirumala via foot path.</p>
